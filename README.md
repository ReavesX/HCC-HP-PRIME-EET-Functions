## Description
This project contains a set of tools for circuit analysis, including calculations for resistance, impedance, Ohm's Law, and more. The scripts are designed to run on Python, but they can also be adapted for use on an HP PRIME G2 Calculator.

## Features
- **Ohm's Law Calculations**
- **Resistance Calculations**
- **JWL/JWC Calculations**
- **BJT Calculations**
- **555 Timer Calculations**

## Installation Instructions

### Setting Up as a New App on HP PRIME G2 Calculator
1. **Download HP Prime Connectivity Kit:**
   Download and install the HP Prime Connectivity Kit from the [HP official website](https://www.hp.com/us-en/shop/pdp/hp-prime-graphing-calculator).

2. **Connect Your Calculator:**
   Connect your HP PRIME G2 Calculator to your computer using a USB cable.

3. **Transfer the Scripts:**
   - Open the HP Prime Connectivity Kit.
   - Drag and drop the folder (`main.py`, `jwl.py`, `tmr_555.py`, `OhmsLaw.py`, `Resistance.py`, `BJTs.py`) into the `Programs` section of the Connectivity Kit.

6. **Save and Run the App:**
   - Save the new program.
   - Exit the program editor and return to the home screen.
   - Select the `CircuitAnalysis` app from the app list.
   - Press `Enter` to run the app.

## Usage
1. **Select an Option:**
   When prompted, enter the corresponding number to perform a specific calculation:
   - `1` for Ohm's Law Calculations
   - `2` for Resistance Calculations
   - `3` for JWL/JWC Calculations
   - `4` for BJT Calculations
   - `5` for 555 Timer Calculations

2. **Follow On-Screen Instructions:**
   Enter the required values as prompted by the program.
